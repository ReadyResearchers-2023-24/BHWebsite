                    <p>Laughing can be considered a sign of enjoyment and happiness. Something slavery is not. On some 
                        plantations, enslaved Africans / African Americans would be punished if they laughed. To avoid being heard laughing, 
                        the enslaved individuals would run to a barrel, stick their heads in it, and laugh. Some say this is where we get the saying 
                        <i>barrel of laughs</i> and also why Black people run when they are laughing in a group of people.

                <p>During slavery, the kitchens were built as a separate building from the rest of the main house where the enslavers lived. 
                    Enslaved Black people had to carry food from the kitchen building to the dinner tables for the enslavers. To ensure the 
                    enslavers that the enslaved Black people were not picking food off the plates they were caring for and/or to ensure that 
                    they did not spit in the food, they were ordered to whistle from the kitchen to the dinner table.</p>

                <p>Edward Brodess died leaving his wife to pay off any remaining debt he had. This led to her having to sell slaves which 
                    included Harriet. After Harriet heard the news she knew she had to run away to prevent being sold away from her family 
                    and to escape being sold further South where conditions were more brutal and dangerous for Black enslaved people.</p>
                <p>That day, she ran away to freedom alone leaving her husband, who refused to leave and her family behind to Pennsylvania 
                    with the help of the Underground Railroad and the usage of its connections of Black and White abolitionists, safe houses, 
                    and escape routes. The journey was 90 miles long.</p>
                <p>Harriet was finally free and got a job in a hotel in Philadelphia where she cooked and cleaned.</p>

                <center><h2>Harriet Returns Home</h2></center>
                <p>Harriett grew uneasy being free without her family and knowing that they were all still enslaved. She also was notified that 
                    her niece, Kessiah Jolley, and her great niece and nephew, James Alfred and Araminta were to be sold off in an auction at a 
                    courthouse in Maryland.</p>
                <p>With the help of members of the Philadelphia Anti-Slavery Society and William Still who worked within the Underground Railroad 
                    as a station master. Harriet arrived in Maryland, she got help from Kessiahs husband, John who was a free man. He reduced Kessiah 
                    and their children from the auction and sailed them across the Chesapeake Bay to Baltimore where Harriet waited for them to begin 
                    the journey. Harriet guided her niece and her nieces children to escape to freedom in Philadelphia. This was Harriet's first trip.</p>
                <p>Later this year, Harriet was admitted into the Underground Railroad as a conductor. With this position, she would know all the 
                    routes leading to free land.</p>
