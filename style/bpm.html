            <p style = "font-size: 19px; ">
                The Black Panther Party was a movement which was led by groups of African 
                American men and women that made an extreme impact on the Black community. 
                Historians consider this movement very controversial within The Civil Rights 
                Movement because of the lack of understanding of it. But by analyzing the Black 
                Panther Movement and its setbacks, and success, they view it as moral and politically 
                good within civil rights. The there main goal was to better the Black Community which 
                resulted in the formation of multiple programs such as the Sickle-Cell Anemia Foundation, 
                Free Breakfast for Children Programs, and Junior High and High School Tutorial Program so 
                that Black people could have access to basic needs and health and fought against police brutality. 
                The Black Panther Party had African American men and women who gave their all for their community, 
                rather they were leaders giving speeches or working behind the scenes within the newsletter. 
                Some of these people are Huey P. Newton, Bobby Seale, Fred Hampton, and Norma Mtume. 
                Being a member of the Black Panther Party was dangerous which sadly due to racism, led to the 
                death of members such as Huey P. Newton and Fred Hampton. But the ones who died and the ones 
                who were a member made a mark on the world.

<!--Bobby Seale -->

<div class = "binfo">
<h3 style = "font-size: 30px; ">Bobby Seale</h3>
<p  style = "font-size: 19px; ">Robert George Seale, also known as Bobby Seale, was born October 22, 1936, and is currently 
    alive today. He is an African American political activist, author, and one of the founders of 
    the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense. Some books Seale had written are Seize the Time, in 
    1970 where one of his famous quotes from the book is <q>Huey was something else. Huey was out of 
    sight. He knew how to do it. Huey was ten motherfuckers.</q> Some other books he wrote are Barbeque’n 
    with Bobby in 1988, and  The Lonely Rage in 1978. He wanted to use the Party to make an example of 
    Oakland for the world by trying to unify and organize the Black community by having survival 
    programs for the organization and his mayoralty campaign along with Elaine Brown in 1973 for unity. 
    Although he had lost the campaign, he received the second most votes out of nine candidates running. 
    Seale created a community organization program that encouraged Party members to enroll in schools 
    such as Grove Street College, Merritt College, Cal State at Hayward, University of California, and 
    Laney College to build their knowledge and form a Black Student Alliance alongside other Black 
    students. Their goal was to raise money to set up survival programs on the campuses of those schools.

<!--Huey P. Newton-->

<div class = "huey">
    <img src = "../img/huey.png" alt = "Huey P. Newton">
</div>
<h3 style = "font-size: 30px; ">Huey P. Newton</h3>
<p style = "font-size: 19px; ">Huey Percy Newton was born on February 17, 1942, in Monroe, Louisiana. He was an African-American 
    revolutionary, one of the founders, minister, official spokesman, and director of The Black Panther 
    Party for Self-Defense. He was the one who got things going when it came to developing the Black 
    Panther Party. Bobby stated that everyone respected Huey and that he would always defend his partners 
    and everyone who was with him.
    The famous picture of him in the Rattan Chair displayed was taken in 1967 by Blair Stapp holding a 
    spear in his right hand and a rifle in his left.
    
    On October 28, 1967, Newton was accused of shooting a police officer, John Frey, of the Oakland 
    Police Dept. He had stopped Newton in his car because he was a Black Panther member. When another 
    officer attended the scene due to a distress call, they found Frey bleeding to death, and at the 
    closest hospital was Newton with a bullet wound in his abdomen. Newton was charged with murder, 
    assault, and kidnapping a man and the trial began in July. February 17, 1968, the <q>Free Huey</q> rally 
    began with about 5,000 people in attendance. He was sentenced to 2-15 years for manslaughter on 
    September 8th and was convinced by a jury of 11 white members and 1 black. But on August 5, 1970, 
    Newton was released from jail on a $50,000 bail.
    In March 1989 Newton was convicted of misappropriating public funds that were meant for a school 
    in Oakland that a Party member had founded and was sentenced to six months in jail. On August 22, 
    1989, in Oakland, California, Newton was shot and killed by Tyrone Robinson who was a member of the 
    Black Guerilla Family and was also a drug dealer. Newton was 47 years of age when he died.

<!--California Chapter-->
<div class = "cal">
    <img src = "../img/cal.png" alt = "California Chapter of the Black Panther Party">
</div>
<h3 style = "font-size: 30px; ">California Chapter of the Black Panther Party</h3>
<p style = "font-size: 19px; ">Within the Black community, Black people fell victim to disenfranchisement. In response, The Lowndes 
    County Freedom Organization, also known as The Black Panther Party of Lowndes County Alabama, was 
    established to bring Black people together to secure their basic rights. One of the biggest rights 
    they fought for was the right to vote within the South. This led to the creation of the Black Panther 
    Party for Self Defense also known as, for short, The Black Panther Party. The Chapter in Oakland, 
    California was developed on October 15, 1966, by two men who were students at Merritt College 
    together, Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale.
    The Panthers of the Oakland Chapter were meant to legally patrol the police and put them under 
    surveillance. They did this by arming themselves with weapons and keeping their distance between 
    themselves and the police. This resulted in fewer police brutality cases. In response, the FBI 
    viewed the Party as their enemy and wanted them to shut down.
    
    As stated by Huey P. Newton, a black panther is<q>an animal who will not attack. If attacked, the 
    black panther backs up until he has no more room to back. Then, the black panther will strike out 
    at his assailant and wipe him out.</q> This is why both parties in California and Alabama decided to 
    take on a Black Panther as their symbol.

<!--Fred Hampton-->
<div class = "fred">
    <img src = "../img/fred.png" alt = "Fred Hampton">
</div>
<h3 style = "font-size: 30px; ">Fred Hampton</h3>
<p style = "font-size: 19px; ">Fredrick <q>Fred</q> Allen Hampton Sr. was an American activist who made a huge community impact in 
    Chicago through politics. Since he was young he has always had the desire to help others and is 
    very observant and even wanted to be a lawyer. Within his late teens, Donald Williams recruited 
    Hampton to help out with the NAACP, which kicked off his path to activism. Within the NAACP he 
    had worked to send food and clothing to people in need in Mississippi while helping Maywood, 
    California to run a black cultural center. He helped the Black community within Chicago realize 
    the importance and how much power politics holds. He then decided to leave the NAACP and join the 
    Black Panther Party after he had met Black Panther member, Lennie Eggleston. This led to the start 
    of him being the Deputy Chairman of the Illinois Chapter of the Black Panther Party in November 1968. 
    On the night of December 1969, Hampton was drugged with fentanyl in his drink by an undercover Party 
    member, William O’Neal, and was shot and killed in his sleep when the Chicago Police Department and the
    FBI raided his home. They did this because of how the Party was growing and impacting others within 
    the Black community.

<!--Norma Mtume-->
<div class = "norma">
    <img src = "../img/norma.png" alt = "Norma Mtume">
</div>
<h3 style = "font-size: 30px; ">Norma Mtume</h3>
<p style = "font-size: 19px; ">Norma Mtume was born in 1949 in San Diego, CA. But she had moved when she was about four years old to 
    South Central Los Angeles. She attended college at California State University in Los Angeles and 
    became involved with the BSU, Black Student Union which is also where she met her husband, Albert 
    Armour. Norma then joined the Black Panther Party in 1969 when her husband's office was raided by the 
    police, he was beaten, sent to the hospital, and sent to jail. She started working in the breakfast 
    program, then typing for Officer of the Day, and then she ran the health clinic here as 
    coordinator / Director in L.A. She left the party in 1977 because she was expelled by Huey. He had 
    her leave because when he returned from Cuba after fleeing there for three years to escape being 
    tried for assault and multiple murders, he learned that there was a witness to one of his crimes. He sent out 
    members to murder her but they were not successful, in a result of this, this led to Mtume had her 
    home raided by the police and sent to jail, and was kicked out of the party by Newton. She believes 
    that instead of using the Party’s resources to help her fight her case, he kicked her out so that he 
    can use them to fight his.

</div>
<h3 style = "font-size: 30px; ">Survival Program: Free Breakfast Program</h3>
<p style = "font-size: 19px; ">In 1969 the Black Panther Party started creating survival programs in which through out the years, 
    they created in total 65 programs. The first survival program was the Free Breakfast for School 
    Children Program. This program's purpose was to offer free healthy breakfast for all children that 
    attend the program. The breakfast meals a day would consist of grits, bacon, scrambled eggs, toast 
    and jelly, ham, hot chocolate, sausage, fresh toast, pancakes, and fruit. Their goal was to expand 
    this program to provide free hot and ready breakfast for hundreds, even thousands of children 
    nationwide in which they were successful in this goal by 1969 while also influencing other groups 
    and organizations to create programs. Programs such as the free food program, the food cooperative 
    program, and nutrition classes.

    To run such a program, there were a few requirements that must be met, one requirement was that 
    they must have a location to host the program suitable for at least 50 people, as well as table and 
    chairs for those 50 children as well as chairs for children that have to wait before eating, and it 
    must include a kitchen. The kitchen selected must have 4 burners as well as an oven, large pots, 
    pans, and serving utensils. In addition, they must provide cups, plates, napkins, knives, spoons, 
    forks, paper, or plastic for the attendees. Because of the demand for space as such, they would 
    host the program in churches or recreation centers.

</div>
<h3 style = "font-size: 30px; ">Survival Program: Child Development Center</h3>
<p style = "font-size: 19px; ">Another program they created was the Child Development Center. Due to racism within America, there 
    was little to no study of the development of a Black children within their <q>pre-school age</q> and 
    younger and Black children in communal lifestyles. The Black Panther Party created this program 
    to observe and evaluate children in their early stages of development, from birth to age one and 
    age one to 2 and a half years old. They did this by making a development schedule that included 
    motor skills, adaptive (problem-solving), verbalization, self-awareness, and responsiveness. 
    They split the different skills to be observed into four lesson plan groups by age in which group 
    one was more of a transition period while the children get used to the so-called <q>toddlers
    schedule</q>  and different activities, once they have they will move to the next group. Group two 
    consisted of sensorimotor skills, space and direction, basic body movement, rhythm, and fine muscle 
    development. Group three consisted of sensorimotor skills, people health, political education, 
    and practice which teaches them about cleaning up and putting on and taking off clothing and shoes. 
    Group four is the last group that consists of primary skills, physical education, political education 
    within personal hygiene, political education, practice within making beds, table setting and grocery 
    shopping, and lastly vocalization.

<!--Sickle-Cell Anemia-->

</div>
<h3 style = "font-size: 30px; ">Survival Program: Sickle-Cell Anemia Research Foundation</h3>
<p style = "font-size: 19px; ">The Black Panther Party created multiple clinics for the Black community who were not able to have 
    access to or afford to go to one to check on their health or get treatment. They did this because 
    the United States Government would not due to racism. It was not a priority to the Government and 
    as a result of this, they raised less than $100,000 in funding. The Sickle-Cell Anemia Research 
    Foundation is one of the programs developed by the Black Panther Party. Sickle-Cell is a rare 
    blood disease found mostly in African Americans in which red blood cells form into a sickle shape 
    and its cells die early, leaving a shortage of healthy red blood cells that can block blood flow 
    causing pain, infection, or death. Within the United States, it is the most common genetic disease. 
    The program was formed in 1971 and its purpose was to educate people about the disease and gather 
    doctors to test citizens, study it, and find treatments and cures. The talk of Sickle-Cell Anemia 
    grew when John Lennon and Yoko Ono invited Black Panther member, Bobby Seale, to talk on his talk 
    show, The Mike Douglas Show, which was popular at the time.
