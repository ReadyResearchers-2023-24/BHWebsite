                The Black Panther Party was a movement which was led by groups of African 
                American men and women that made an extreme impact on the Black community. 
                Historians consider this movement very controversial within The Civil Rights 
                Movement because of the lack of understanding of it. But by analyzing the Black 
                Panther Movement and its setbacks, and success, they view it as moral and politically 
                good within civil rights. The there main goal was to better the Black Community which 
                resulted in the formation of multiple programs such as the Sickle-Cell Anemia Foundation, 
                Free Breakfast for Children Programs, and Junior High and High School Tutorial Program so 
                that Black people could have access to basic needs and health and fought against police brutality. 
                The Black Panther Party had African American men and women who gave their all for their community, 
                rather they were leaders giving speeches or working behind the scenes within the newsletter. 
                Some of these people are Huey P. Newton, Bobby Seale, Fred Hampton, and Norma Mtume. 
                Being a member of the Black Panther Party was dangerous which sadly due to racism, led to the 
                death of members such as Huey P. Newton and Fred Hampton. But the ones who died and the ones 
                who were a member made a mark on the world.
