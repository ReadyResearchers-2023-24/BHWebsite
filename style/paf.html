                    <b><h2>1900</h2></b>
                    <p>All white minstrel group singers were heavly talking about the importance of a flag 
                        designed to respresent ones race. Will A. Heelan and J. Fred Helf created a song titled 
                        <i>Every Race Has A Flag But the Coon</i>

                <b><h2>July 20, 1914</h2></b>
                    <p>The UNIA was founded by Marcus Garvey when he was only 28 years old. 
                        The association was very big on Black pride, redeeming Africa from the 
                        rule of white athority, and unity within the African American community.</p>
                    <p>The meaning of this flag is to symbolize unity of Black people as a nation despite
                        slavery.

                <p>Marcus Gavery, along with members of the UNIA, created the Pan-Arican flag using
                    the colors red, black, and green. This flag was made in response to <i>Every Race 
                    Has a Flag but the Coon"</i> a folk song made to mock Black people.</p>
                <center><h3>Symbols of Solidarity</h3></center>
                <h4 style="color: red";></h4style>Red: Blood</h4>
                <p>The red within the flag represents the connection of all people of 
                    African ancestry and the blood that was shed for liberation</p>
                <h4 style="color: black";></h4style>Black: Nation - Not State</h4>
                <p>The black does not represent the people as a state because that is unknown for sure. Therefore black represents the people as a nation.
                    Green: Land
                    The green represents the great and natural wealth of Africa and its land
                    African countries such as Kenya, Malawi, and Libya share the same color scheme</p>
