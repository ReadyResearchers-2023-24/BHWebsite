            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>My name is Rian Watson, I am from Pittsburgh, PA and a senior at Allegheny College 
            in Meadville, PA majoring in Computer Science minoring in Black Studies. I created this website
            for my senior project and I choose to create a website because I am interested in web development
            and/or UI/UX design as a carrer. Some other projects I have done is a cooking website for a
            catering business name BoomGrillx and created my portfolio</p>

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>The motivation for this project is to help not only the Black community, but 
            all communities learn about Black history and that there is more to it than just enslavement. 
            This website will teach people facts and information that are not taught in schools so that 
            they can look at Black history in a different light. Another reason is to create one website 
            where people can learn about Black history. When doing papers and research people have to 
            jump from site to site to get information about one thing. However, the website I am creating 
            will reduce the amount of time people will spend looking up different websites. I also want to 
            make this as much information as possible by putting non-well-known facts about Black history 
            within the website.
