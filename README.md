# Black History Website

## Intro/Motivation

The motivation for this project to help not only the Black community, but all communites learn about Black history and that their is more to it that just enslavement. This website will teach people facts and information that is not taught in schools so that they are able to look at Black history in a different light. Another reason is to create one website where people can learn about Black history. When doing papers and research people have to jump from site to site to get information about one thing. However, the website I am creating will reduce the amount of time people will spend looking up different websites. I also want to make this as much information as possible by putting non well-known facts about Black history within the website.
