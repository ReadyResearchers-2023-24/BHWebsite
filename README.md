# Black History Website

## Intro/Motivation

The motivation for this project is to help not only the Black community, but all communities learn about Black history and that there is more to it than just enslavement. This website will teach people facts and information that are not taught in schools so that they can look at Black history in a different light. Another reason is to create one website where people can learn about Black history. When doing papers and research people have to jump from site to site to get information about one thing. However, the website I am creating will reduce the amount of time people will spend looking up different websites. I also want to make this as much information as possible by putting non-well-known facts about Black history within the website.

## Realted Work
A project I have worked on is a prototype for this project. It has a starting page with one of the three topics that are clickable and will take you to a separate page with information related to the topic clicked on. That topic is The Black Panther Movement. The clicked-on page has information related to the subject and pictures for visual purposes. A way to access the prototype is by going to cmpsc-580-Allegheny-College-Spring-2023/assignment07-watson02 repository. Then you will click on the style folder and you will see two HTML files, index and index-move. You will click on index.HTML for the home page.

---Other Projects---
One project I have worked on is a cooking website for a catering business called BoomGrillx founded and run by Adekoyejo Balogun, a student at Allegheny College. The website included a starting page with his brand log and two other pictures below it that when clicked on will take you to another page. One is a bio page about him, his background, and how and why he started this brand. The other includes pictures of a few dishes he has made, the ingredients, and along with instructions on how to make them.

Another project I have worked on is my portfolio. It includes a section that lists the different topics, a mission statement, the link to my resume, pictures of the languages I experience with, work samples with links, and more. The link to the website can be found here: https://watson02.github.io.


## Technical Details
The website is going to start with a home page with the title of the site in the center and at the very top of the page. Under it, there is a tab bar with the different topic headings. The home topic is the home page and its background is red. The other topic's background is dark grey. When the cursor is hovered over them the topic's color will go from white to black. Also, a green bar will display under it, as it also does for the home topic. These topics will be clickable and when clicked on, will take the user to a different page displaying information about that topic. For demo purposes, the only tab that works is for the Black Panther Movement tab. Under the tab bar, there are ten different topics put into five columns in alphabetical order along with a picture to represent it. Each picture will be clickable which when clicked on, you will be sent to another page about that specific topic. As with the tab bar, the only clickable image is the Black Panther Movement topic for demo purposes. Toward the end of the topics, there will be an option for the users to get to know about me and why I chose to create the site. Under that, there will be a feedback form for users to submit their thoughts and opinions on the website so I know what edits I should make within the site or what to add and/or take out. It asks the user for their first and last name, and email and has a message bar that can expand. When the user clicks submit, the form will be sent to my email.

The Black Panther Movement page has a tab bar at the very top and under it, a title of the page along with the years 1966-1982 to represent how long this movement lasted. Different headings will teach the user about the party, Bobby Seale, Huey P. Newton, its manifesto, its rules, and programs created within the movement. Each heading has a picture for visual purposes.
