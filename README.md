# Black History Website

The goal for this project is to create one website where people can learn about Black history. When doing papers and research people have to jump from site to site to get information about one thing. However, the website I am creating will reduce the amount of time people will spend looking up different websites. I also want to make this as much information as possible by putting non well-known facts about Black history within the website.
