# Black History Website

## Intro/Motivation

The motivation for this project is to help not only the Black community, but all communities learn about Black history and that there is more to it than just enslavement. This website will teach people facts and information that are not taught in schools so that they can look at Black history in a different light. Another reason is to create one website where people can learn about Black history. When doing papers and research people have to jump from site to site to get information about one thing. However, the website I am creating will reduce the amount of time people will spend looking up different websites. I also want to make this as much information as possible by putting non-well-known facts about Black history within the website.

## Realted Work
A project I have worked on is a prototype for this project. It has a starting page with topics that are clickable and will take you to a separate page with information related to the topic clicked on. The clicked-on page had information related to the topic and pictures for visual purposes.

---Other Projects---
One project I have worked on is a cooking website for a catering business called BoomGrillx founded and run by Adekoyejo Balogun, another student on campus. The website included a starting page with his brand log and two other pictures below it that when clicked on will go to another page. One is a bishop about him and the other includes pictures of a few dishes he has made, the ingredients, along instructions.

Another project I have worked on is my portfolio. It includes a mission statement, pictures of the languages I have coded with, work samples with links, and more.


## Technical Details
The website is going to start with a starting page with the title and under it in 4-5 columns, the different topics. The topics will have the name of it along with a picture for visual purposes. Each picture will be clickable which when clicked on, you will be sent to another page about that specific topic. The starting page will also have a search engine so you can look up a topic title and it will appear so it is easier for the user to find what they are looking for. Toward the end of the topics, there will be an option for the users to get to know about the creator of the website which is me. They will know about me, my involvement, and my reason and goals for the website. Under that, there will be a feedback form for users to submit their thoughts and opinions on the website so I know what edits I should make within the site or what to add and/or take out.
